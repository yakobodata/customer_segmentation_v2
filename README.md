# Data Engineering Project in the financial services industry
This project intends to show how we can use Data engineering to avail data to a marketing department in the financial services organization to help them maximize their efforts in marketing particular products to specific customers

# Business needs

The main aim of the business is to maximize profits and lower its costs . Hypothetically our data team was asked by the marketing department to help it answer some questions such that it can be effective in the way they spend their budget.

- Are we targeting young professionals, middle-aged individuals, or retirees?

- What are their income levels?

- Can we be able to assess the level of digital adoption among potential customers. This will influence the choice of digital channels for marketing and service delivery that we shall use?

- Are we able to identify life stages such as starting a career, getting married, having children, or nearing retirement and Tailor services to address specific needs at each stage?

- Can we gauge preferences for digital banking services versus traditional in-person interactions.
